# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

Solutions will primarily be in rust, a language I've never used before, so they
might suck :)

Additionally, I'll be writing ruby one-liners until I get bored with it or it
gets too cumbersome. These are solutions that may take up more than one line
for formatting reasons or getting input, but could be written on one line
without semicolons.
